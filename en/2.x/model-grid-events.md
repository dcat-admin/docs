# Data table events

### Initialization


The `Grid::resolving` method allows you to listen for table initialization events.


The developer can change some of the settings or behavior of `Grid` in both events, for example, to disable certain actions, by adding the following code to `app/Admin/bootstrap.php`.

```php
use Dcat\Admin\Grid;

Grid::resolving(function (Grid $grid) {
    $grid->disableActions();

    $grid->disablePagination();

    $grid->disableCreateButton();

    $grid->disableFilter();

    $grid->disableRowSelector();

    $grid->disableTools();

    $grid->disableExport();
});


// Only need to listen once.
Grid::resolving(function (Grid $grid) {
    ...
}, true);
```
This way you don't have to set it in the code of each controller.

If, after the global setting, you want to turn on the setting in one of the tables, for example to turn on the display action column, call `$grid->disableActions(false);` on the corresponding instance.


### Building

The `Grid::composing` method allows you to listen for events when the table is called.

```php
Grid::composing(function (Grid $grid) {
    ...
});

// You only need to listen in once.
Grid::composing(function (Grid $grid) {
    ...
}, true);
```

### Fetching

Listen for the event before the form gets data, which is triggered after the `composing` event.

```php
$grid->listen(Grid\Events\Fetching::class, function ($grid) {

});


// can be used in the composing event.
Grid::composing(function (Grid $grid) {
    $grid->listen(Grid\Events\Fetching::class, function ($grid) {
        ...
    });
});
```

### Fetched

Listen to events after the table has been retrieved. By listening to this event, you can modify data in bulk, see the following example

```php
$grid->listen(Grid\Events\Fetched::class, function ($grid, Collection $rows) {
	// $collection This is the current model collection of table data, which you can read or modify according to your needs.

    $rows->transform(function ($row) {
        // Change row data
        $row['name'] = $row['first_name'].' '.$row['last_name'];
        
        return $row;
    });
});
```

### ApplyFilter

listens for form filter search events, which are triggered only when the filter has search criteria

```php
$grid->listen(Grid\Events\ApplyFilter::class, function ($grid, array $conditions) {
	// $conditions Array of search criteria generated by the current filter

    dd('Form filter', $conditions);
});
```


### ApplyQuickSearch

listens for the form quick search event, which is triggered only when there is a value in the quick search input box

```php
$grid->listen(Grid\Events\ApplyQuickSearch::class, function ($grid, $input) {
	// $input Search keywords

    dd('Quick Search', $input);
});
```

### ApplySelector

listens for form specification filter events, which are triggered only when the specification filter selects an option

```php
$grid->listen(Grid\Events\ApplySelector::class, function ($grid, array $input) {
	// $input Array of options selected by the filter

    dd('Form specification filters', $input);
});
```



### rows callbacks

The `Grid::rows` method allows you to listen for events after the table gets data.

```php
use Dcat\Admin\Grid\Row;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

$grid->rows(function (Collection $rows) {
    /**
     * Get the first line of data
     *
     * @var Row $firstRow
     */
    $firstRow = $rows->first();

    // Set tr html attribute.
    $firstRow->setAttributes(['name' => '....']);
    
    if ($firstRow) {
        // Get the id of the first line
        $id = $firstRow->id;
        // to arrays
        $row = $firstRow->toArray();
    }
});
```
